The goal of this project is to ensure the safety of people and make sure people follow the necessary rules.
This is achieved by 

1. Face Mask Detection
 - The goal is to check if people are wearing a mask properly or not.
 - Cameras near the entrance of shops can be used for face mask detection.
 - These cameras can be connected to a system like a speaker, screen, and auto-door. These will notify the person and prompt them to wear mask properly before entering the shop.
 - The face mask detection model is made using TensorFlow Object Detection API.
 - faster_rcnn_inception_v2 model has been used for training the Face Mask Detector.
 - The model consists of 3 classes: "with_mask","without_mask" and "mask_weared_incorrect".

2. Mobile application for ordering
  - The goal is to reduce the exposure to the virus by converting physical waiting lines to digital waiting lines.
  - People will be able to use his app to order the necessary items from home and they will be allocated a pick-up time slot, later they can go and pick up the order safely at the given time.
  - The prototyping of the app was done on Adobe XD.
  - The app is built on Android Studio, using Java (back-end) and XML (front-end).
  - The app leverages the IBM Cloud App ID service which easily adds authentication for mobile apps.
  - Currently, the app can be utilised by restaurants. We plan on adding functionality for various other businesses such as medical stores, grocery stores.

3. Distance Tracking Algorithm
  - The goal is to track the distance between people inside a shop and prompt them to maintain social distancing.
  - Location (latitude and longitude) of all people inside the shop will be sent to Google Firebase real-time database.
  - Distance between people will be calculated using their location and if people are close to each other (less than 6 ft distance), they will be notified that people are within their range.
  - Currently, the algorithm is made in Python. We plan on converting it to JAVA and integrating it with the app.

SafeShop is better than exisiting technologies. None of the technologies out there allows users to track distance and maintain social distancing.
SafeShop is ultimate safety package, correct use of technology will help us reduce and prevent further spread of virus.
